            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Jing Yi, currently an undergraduate in Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in NTU, Singapore. I love taking photos for travels and for people! In an age of moving on and non-stop motion, I think photography makes time for myself to pause and allows for moments to breathe. It is in these moments I start noticing the mundane and seeing the life in everyday activities. This is a place for me to reflect and grow, so I can have something to look back upon in the future. Please enjoy! </p>
